HomeAway From Home: Data Structures and Algorithms Project
ðŸš€ Overview
This project implements the core system for HomeAway From Home, an application designed for the Data Structures and Algorithms (AED) course. The system manages a defined geographical area, various service types (eating, lodging, leisure), and student users (bookish, outgoing, thrifty). It allows for personalized interactions such as tracking student locations, rating services, and providing relevant service recommendations based on student preferences and proximity.
